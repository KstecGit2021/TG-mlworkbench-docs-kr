# Cloud Deployment Notebooks

The directories within contain resources to deploy your own trained GNN to the cloud as a REST endpoint.
Currently, `azure_ml` and `google_vertexai` are supported, with `aws_sagemaker` coming soon. 
Please note that you will have to change various parameters in the notebooks to match your authentication details.
